# Airline Challenge


The file `daily_flight_data.csv` contains flight data for one day's worth
of flights.  

The format of the file is as follows:

`Flight Number,Plane Identifier,Origin,Destination,Miles,Passengers`

In North America, every airplane is identified by a unique identifier starting with the letter `N`.

**Challenge 1**

Write code that can answer these questions. (The answers is provided so that you'll know when your code is working correctly.)

You can create as many different files in this folder as you need.

1. How many flights are there in one day? (Answer: 241)
2. How many planes are in the fleet? (Answer: 101)
3. Which flight number represents the longest flight in miles? (Answer: 142)

**Challenge 2**

Design a class domain model to make things easier to work with,
remove redundancy, and make the code clearer.
